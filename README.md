Project Proposal

Introduction:
There are countless sources of fake news coming from programmed bots and continue to spread false information 24/7.Fake news has grown from being sent via emails to attacking social media. Fake news is written and published usually with the intent to mislead in order to damage an agency, entity. 
The problem is real and hard to solve because the bots are getting better and it is not simple to detect when the information is true or not all time, we need better systems that helps us understand the patterns of fake news to improve the social media.
Through this project I would like to detect the fake news with a deep learning approach. 

Literature Review:
The project involves python libraries that I have learnt during my masters. I would like to perform EDA, Data Visualization, Text Analytics, Machine Learning models.

Basic Idea for Data Analysis:
The dataset has been extracted from the news aggregator dataset from the UCI machine learning repository was used to extract real news this dataset consists of links to the originally published news articles I have extracted the URLs.
Fake news I used Kaggle dataset getting real about fake news dataset. There are two csv files fake and true. 

Main steps involved in the project:
1.	Data Cleaning
2.	EDA
3.	Modeling
4.	Decision tree classifier
5.	Random Forest Classifier
